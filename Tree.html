		<!--1st-->
		<p>I think that I shall never see </p>
		<p>A poem lovely as a tree.</p>
		&nbsp;

		<!--2nd-->
		<p>A tree whose hungry mouth is prest</p>
		<p>Against the earthâ€™s sweet flowing breast;</p>
		&nbsp;

		<!--3rd-->
		<p>A tree that looks at God all day,</p>
		<p>And lifts her leafy arms to pray;</p>
		&nbsp;

		<!--4th-->
		<p>A tree that may in Summer wear</p>
		<p>A nest of robins in her hair;</p>		
		&nbsp;

		<!--5th-->
		<p>Upon whosde bosom snow has lain:</p>
		<p>Who intimidate live with rain.</p>
		&nbsp;

		<!--6th-->
		<p>Poems are made by fools like me,</p>
		<p>But only God can make a tree</p>
